I'm a product designer that likes to solve puzzles, build tools and make people's jobs easier. I have a background in business, design, and tech, and I’ve worked for more than 15 years to solve problems with technology. 

I'm a strategic thinker that loves the challenge of creating new products and services. I have experience working with startups, small businesses, and enterprise companies to solve problems through design.
